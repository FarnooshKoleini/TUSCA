TUSCA+
=======
The complementary nature of ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) and Tucker3 tensor decompositions (TUSCA+) is demonstrated on designed datasets. We show how ASCA can be used to (a) identify statistically sufficient Tucker3 models; (b) identify statistically important triads making their interpretation easier; and (c) eliminate non-significant triads making visualization and interpretation simpler. 
ASCA+ code was used from https://github.com/josecamachop/MEDA-Toolbox.
